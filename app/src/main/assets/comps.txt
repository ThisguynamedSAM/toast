Your outfit is amayzun
Gee, you smell nice
Your eyes are gorgeous
Have you lost weight?
Just marry me... just do it
You're the smartest person I know
You're so interesting!
Every time i'm away from you, my heart is like; 'well this sucks'
You're cooler than a childhood secret handshake
You're that nothing, when people ask me what i'm thinking about
You play by your own rules and I admire that
I really like that you understand my advanced dialect of sarcasm
